# Earthbound Companion
This companion WebApp aims to help EarthBound players have a better gameplay experience.
This application doesn't require a backend, so you can clone this repo and copy it to a webserver as is. The only parameter you need to change is the ```appRoot``` variable in the ```scripts/main.js``` file to reflect your web server's URL.
